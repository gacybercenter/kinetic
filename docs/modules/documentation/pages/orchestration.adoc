= Kinetic Service Orchestration

[#orchestration]
== Automated Orchestration of Openstack Infrastructure Services

To initiate a full orchestration of the Openstack environment:

----
salt-run state.orch orch
----

This rebuilds the environment based on if `[type]` is enabled in
*kinetic-pillar* in the `/environment/hosts.sls` file.

Example:

----
hosts:
  cache: <1>
    style: virtual
    enabled: False <2>
    count: 1
    ram: 8192000
    cpu: 2
    os: ubuntu2004
    disk: 512G
    networks:
      management:
        interfaces: [ens3]
----

<1> This is the `[type]` value +
<2> If the `enabled` parameter is set to the value `True` the virtual +
    machine or physical host will rebuild/build. If `enabled` is set to +
    the value `False` it will not rebuild/build.

[#build]
== Manual Orchestration of Openstack Infrastructure Services

CAUTION: Destroying the entire environment isn't always a necessity +
during rebuild, and make sure you are in the correct salt master +
before proceeding with these steps

[#destroy_ceph]
=== Zeroize Storage Nodes

NOTE: If not rebuilding storage, you will only need to destroy Ceph pools

.Destroying Ceph Pools
[%collapsible%open]
====

[,bash]
----
include::example$destroy_ceph_pools.sh[]
----

====

IMPORTANT: If rebuilding Ceph, this will power off all of the
           physical storage nodes as well as remove their public keys.

[,bash]
----
salt 'controller*' state.apply /orch/states/virtual_zero pillar='{"type":"cephmon"}'; salt-key -d cephmon* -y

salt 'storage*' system.poweroff
salt-key -d 'storage*' -y
----


=== Zeroize Virtual OpenStack Service Nodes:
All currently running Openstack services must be zeriozed. This will
vary based on the currently deployed services:

[,bash]
----
include::example$destroy_env.sh[]
----

[#destroy_compute]
=== Zeroize Compute Nodes

NOTE: This will power off all of the physical compute and container
      nodes and remove their public keys

[,bash]
----
salt 'compute*' system.poweroff
salt-key -d 'compute*' -y

salt 'container*' system.poweroff
salt-key -d 'container*' -y
----


[#destroy_controller]
=== Zeroize Controller Nodes

IMPORTANT: If rebuilding the entire environment, this will power off +
           all of the physical controller nodes as well as remove their public keys.

[,bash]
----
salt 'controller*' system.poweroff
salt-key -d 'controller*' -y
----

Our next step will be to clear any and all cached data leveraging our 
salt master:

[,bash]
----
#!/bin/bash
# clear any cached assignments for physical pxe boots
salt pxe* cmd.run 'rm -f /var/www/html/assignments/*'
salt pxe* cmd.run 'rm -rf /srv/tftp/assignments/*'
salt \* saltutil.clear_cache

# These system restarts will ensure that Salt pulls up-to-data code
systemctl restart salt-master
systemctl restart salt-minion

# this will ensure all proper salt values are populated
salt '*' saltutil.sync_all
salt '*' saltutil.refresh_pillar
salt '*' mine.update
salt 'salt*' mine.get pxe* redfish.gather_endpoints
----

[#build_services]
=== Provision Openstack Services

NOTE: Ensure everything has been high stated before building the services

[,bash]
----
salt \* state.highstate
----

NOTE: Order of operations matter to meet dependency requirements that are +
      built into the automation

==== Phase 0
If this is an initial build, the physical controller node will be need to
be built first. 

[,bash]
----
salt-run state.orch orch.generate pillar='{"type":"controller"}'
----

This step requires building of cache first to help save bandwidth for
package installations

[,bash]
----
salt-run state.orch orch.generate pillar='{"type":"cache"}'
salt-run state.orch orch.generate pillar='{"type":"haproxy"}'
----

NOTE: Due to current development for a *TNSR* the your NAT configurations +
      may need to be manually pointed to the correct internal address for +
      the haproxy service.

==== Phase 1

[,bash]
----
salt-run state.orch orch.generate pillar='{"type":"mysql"}'
----

IMPORTANT: If you are rebuilding CEPH, the cephmon nodes need to be rebuilt during this phase.

[,bash]
----
salt-run state.orch orch.generate pillar='{"type":"cephmon"}'
----

.If using network-ovn as the network backend, the ovsdb node needs to be created
[%collapsible]
====
[,bash]
----
salt-run state.orch orch.generate pillar='{"type":"ovsdb"}'
----
====

[,bash]
----
salt-run state.orch orch.generate pillar='{"type":"etcd"}'
salt-run state.orch orch.generate pillar='{"type":"rabbitmq"}'
salt-run state.orch orch.generate pillar='{"type":"memcached"}'
salt-run state.orch orch.generate pillar='{"type":"bind"}'
----

NOTE: These four services can be provisioned simultaneously

==== Phase 2

[,bash]
----
salt-run state.orch orch.generate pillar='{"type":"keystone"}'
----

// haproxy needs highstated

IMPORTANT: If you are rebuilding CEPH, then storage node needs to be rebuilt during this phase.

[,bash]
----
salt-run state.orch orch.generate pillar='{"type":"storage"}'
----

==== Phase 3

// need to add an item here in relation to the network service...

[,bash]
----
# Dependincies Completed in Prior Phases
salt-run state.orch orch.generate pillar='{"type":"glance"}'
salt-run state.orch orch.generate pillar='{"type":"horizon"}'
salt-run state.orch orch.generate pillar='{"type":"guacamole"}'
salt-run state.orch orch.generate pillar='{"type":"heat"}'
salt-run state.orch orch.generate pillar='{"type":"designate"}'
salt-run state.orch orch.generate pillar='{"type":"swift"}'
salt-run state.orch orch.generate pillar='{"type":"zun"}'

# Dependancy Order Group
salt-run state.orch orch.generate pillar='{"type":"cinder"}'
salt-run state.orch orch.generate pillar='{"type":"volume"}'

# Dependancy Order Group
salt-run state.orch orch.generate pillar='{"type":"placement"}'
salt-run state.orch orch.generate pillar='{"type":"nova"}'

.Optional Kinetic Services
[%collapsible]
====
The following services are optional integrated services that can be used
within the environment for additional capabilities, but are not routinely
validated for functionality through orchestration.

[,bash]
----
salt-run state.orch orch.generate pillar='{"type":"sahara"}'
salt-run state.orch orch.generate pillar='{"type":"barbican"}'
salt-run state.orch orch.generate pillar='{"type":"magnum"}'
salt-run state.orch orch.generate pillar='{"type":"share"}'
salt-run state.orch orch.generate pillar='{"type":"mds"}'
salt-run state.orch orch.generate pillar='{"type":"cyborg"}'
salt-run state.orch orch.generate pillar='{"type":"jproxy"}'
salt-run state.orch orch.generate pillar='{"type":"gpu"}'
----
====


.If using network-ovn as the network backend
[%collapsible]
====
[,bash]
----
salt-run state.orch orch.generate pillar='{"type":"neutron"}'
----
====

.If using openvswitch as the network backend
[%collapsible%open]
====
[,bash]
----
# Dependancy Order Group
salt-run state.orch orch.generate pillar='{"type":"neutron"}'
salt-run state.orch orch.generate pillar='{"type":"network"}'
----
====

==== Phase 4

[,bash]
----
salt-run state.orch orch.generate pillar='{"type":"compute"}'
salt-run state.orch orch.generate pillar='{"type":"container"}'
----

[#troubleshooting]
=== Troubleshooting
Outlined are just a few examples and is not meant to be a full troubleshooting guide.

*Dependancy Errors* +
This is simply showing that a dependancy for the service was not met. This may happen when a service doesn't complete a build phase.

[,bash]
----
[ERROR   ] {'return': {'ready': False, 'type': 'neutron', 'comment': ['ovsdb-b5111677-cd25-5af8-8f04-f9169bbd685c is install but needs to be configure', 'ovsdb-c3906691-96df-5818-a688-eac4edd3d939 is install but needs to be configure', 'ovsdb-e1346c3d-b25e-5ade-b539-a659d208af6c is install but needs to be configure']}}
----

Alternatively this may happen if a service was started too early after troubleshooting issues with a broken build. The build_phase can be set manually with the following commands:

[,bash]
----
salt '<service>' grains.setval build_phase configure
salt '<service>' mine.update
----
