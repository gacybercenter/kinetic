==  Orchestration Overview
This outlines the overall *Orchestration* philosophy that the the
Kinetic Framework was designed to follow. In order to allow for rapid
recovery in cases of compromise to Confidentiality, Integrity, and
Availability (CIA), the Kinetic Framework was designed to be as
modular as possible. This allows for the system to be easily
reconfigured and redeployed to support integrations of a variety of
services.

=== Orchestration `salt-run state.orch orch`

To start the provisioning process, any previously created services
must be removed. Within the init stage, enabled services are powered
off and their keys are deleted. Then, a salt runner is created for
every endpoint type. These runners will be utilized during the
provisioning process. After the runners have been created, each service
type is sent to the "waiting room" by calling `orch/waiting_room.sls``. 

.Understanding `orch/init.sls`
[%collapsible]
====
For each enabled host in the pillar, the system is powered off and
the keys are deleted. After this, the state iterates through each of
these hosts and creates a variable called 'role'. For any physical
systems, their 'role' attribute is changed to 'physical'. For all other
systems, the 'role' attribute is set to the type found in the pillar. 
====
=== orch/waiting_room.sls

The aptly named `orch/waiting_room.sls` acts as a lobby for all
services waiting to be provisioned. Because of the complex dependencies
across all service types, they cannot be provisioned at the same time.
Once all dependencies are met, the service is released from the waiting
room and calls `orch/generate.sls` for each endpoint's runner. 

.Understanding `orch/waiting_room.sls` and `runners/needs.py`
[%collapsible]
====
Within the salt runner, there is a Python module called `needs.py`.
This state routinely calls `needs.check_all` until this function returns
true. `Needs.check_all` iterates through the given array of needs to
check the current status. If the dependency's status is not complete or
available for assessment, the variable 'phase_ok' is set to false. If
the function gets through the iteration without setting 'phase_ok' to
false, it will change the 'ready' value in the return dicitonary to true.
At that point, the service is released from the waiting room and continues
provisioning by calling `orch/generate.sls` for each endpoint's runner. 
====

=== orch/generate.sls

The generate module prepares the salt runners to provision each service
type. It creates a dictionary called `targets`, which is populated with
the ID of each endpoint. The style of each service (physical or virtual)
is taken directly from the kinetic-pillar and the course of action differs
accordingly.

Physical Services:

* References the pillar to find the UUID using a `redfish.py` function
called `redfish.gather_endpoints`. This Python function iterates over IP
addresses in the network range and attempts to establish a Redfish
connection to each IP address. If this is successful it will retrieve
the endpoints information. The systems are stored in a dictionary with
the UUIDs as keys and IP addresses as values. 

[.lead]
Virtual Services:

* Because the virtual services do not have UUIDs, this code path generates
its target IDs by finding the controllers, calculating an offset, and then
assigning values based on the ID. Specific values assigned depend on the
loop index, controllers discovered and generated UUIDs. 

Now, there is a dictionary of target UUIDs. For the rest of the process,
this dictionary is referenced to provision each endpoint.

==== 
=== orch/zeroize.sls

This module has two code paths, each depending on the style of the service.
Physical services will call `redfish.set_bootonce` and `redfish.reset_host`,
more functions within the redfish.py module. 

[.lead]
orch/states/virtualzero.sls

* This state is only called when using `orch/zeroize.sls` on virtual
endpoints. This state looks for endpoints matching the specified type.
It then stops them and removes their files and logs.

[.lead] 
orch/states/virtualprep.sls

* This state is only called when using `orch/zerioze.sls` on virtual
endpoints. This state uses SaltStack's file management cappabilities
to define each endpoint's configuration files.

=== orch/provision

This state was called by `orch/generate.sls` _after_ `orch/zeroize.sls`
is completed. This state starts by importing the following modules. After
each of them have been run, the endpoint will be successfully orchestrated.
It is important to note that they are called in this order and each one
requires the previous. 


.Understanding `formulas/common/macros/orchestration.sls`
[%collapsible]
====
This macro is used to construct needs-check routines. It will loop back
until all networking dependancies have been met. This uses the same `needs.py`
module used in `waiting_room.sls`. This macro calls `needs.check_one`,
which checks if dependencies are met for a specific type or phase.  
====

.Understanding `formulas/common/base.sls`
[%collapsible]
====
This module configures various settings on each endpoint based on its type,
role, and operating system. First, the system time settings are set, SSH
keys are managed, and Rsyslog is configured. 
====

.Understanding `formulas/common/networking.sls`
[%collapsible]
====
This module is designed to configure and manage network interfaces for each
endpoint. It provides configuration for all relevant types of interfaces:
regular, bonded, bridged, and bonded & bridged. After installing Python3 and
Pyroute2, this module ensures that only needed services are enabled. To create
a bridge interface, the module creates a .netdev file making the bridged
interface object. It then creates a .network file associating the physical
interface with the bridged interface object. 
====

.Understanding `formulas/{{ role }}/install.sls`
[%collapsible]
====
There is a specific `install.sls` module for each endpoint type. This module is
used to install software packages and Python libraries based on what the endpoint
needs.
====

.Understanding `formulas/{{ role }}//configure.sls`
[%collapsible]
====
Similarly to the `install.sls` module, there is also a specific `configure.sls`
module for each endpoint type. This module is used to configure the previously
installed packages and libraries.
