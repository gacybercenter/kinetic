[Filters]

# By installing the following, the local admin is asserting that:
#
# 1. The python module load path used by privsep-helper
#    command as root (as started by sudo/rootwrap) is trusted.
# 2. Any oslo.config files matching the --config-file
#    arguments below are trusted.
# 3. Users allowed to run sudo/rootwrap with this configuration(*) are
#    also allowed to invoke python "entrypoint" functions from
#    --privsep_context with the additional (possibly root) privileges
#    configured for that context.
#
# (*) ie: the user is allowed by /etc/sudoers to run rootwrap as root
#
# In particular, the oslo.config and python module path must not
# be writeable by the unprivileged user.
